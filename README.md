bash-stuff
==========

A collection of scripts that I've written in Bash that might be useful to some people.  Some of the ones included are:

* BashLog - A small (probably inefficient) subset of Prolog.
* template.bash - A simple templating system used to generate static files and used in another project, Game to Code.
* ls-R.bash - Prints the results of `ls -R` so that every file gets its own line with a full path.
* objects.bash - Object-oriented Bash code using the filesystem.
* sorcerer.bash - Gives a simple function, `was_sourced` for use with libraries that run code when not used as a library.
* twodee-arrays.bash - A library that gives Bash not only 2D, but n-dimensional arrays and a nice syntax to access and set values with
* thread.bash - A library that helps with thread creation and joining to help with parallel processing.
* colorize.bash - Gives a few functions to help make output messages colorful, including one that gives a string one specific color so humans can check for equality easier.
* bashrc.bash - The $HOME/.bashrc file that I currently use.
